## About

Habit Tracker app helps you keep track of your habits ðŸ’ª Due to my lack of design skills I took inspiration of [this](https://https://www.behance.net/gallery/107179009/Habit-Sleep-Tracker-UIUX-Design) beautifull UX/UI design by Anastasia Shorohova.

### What I learned

So far I have learned Authentication with Firebase, the whole signing up/signing in process. Also realtime Firestore DB was a bit of a challenge to set up and structure data in logical documents/collections shallow object. It's my first time using Material-UI, so customizing them to resebmle designs was also new for me. It's still in development so more new challenges will occur for sure.
