## What I have learned

I have learned a lot of new things while building this application. It was my first bigger application, so a lot of problems occurred. I have learned Authentication with Firebase, signing up/signing in process. Also realtime Firestore DB was a bit of a challenge to set up and structure data in logical documents/collections shallow object. I've also used Firestore Cloud to upload images.

A big challenge was to control the asynchronism of function execution and maintaining the current state of variables available for the whole application.

I also learned more about git, branching, merging and maintaining codebase. 

It was my first time using Material-UI. Now I think pure tailwind components or Flowbite library would have been a better choice, because it was a lot overriding styles with such a custom design. I've also gained confidence in building more sophisticated and complicated UI components and Responsive Layouts.
