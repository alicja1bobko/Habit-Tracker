### What I learned

So far I have learned Authentication with Firebase, the whole signing up/signing in process. Also realtime Firestore DB was a bit of a challenge to set up and structure data in logical documents/collections shallow object. It's my first time using Material-UI, so customizing them to resebmle designs was also new for me. It's still in development so more new challenges will occur for sure.
